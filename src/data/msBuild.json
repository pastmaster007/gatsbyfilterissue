Ma was the inspiration for the best-selling book Bringing Down the House and the hit movie, 21, which topped the box office in its first two weeks. He has since helped start four different companies including CircleLending (sold to Virgin) and Citizen Sports (sold to Yahoo) and become a sought-after corporate speaker. Beyond his work as an entrepreneur, Ma has been a pioneer in the “Moneyball” movement working with professional sports teams like the San Francisco 49ers and the Portland Trail Blazers and media powerhouses like ESPN and Major League Baseball Advanced Media, helping them to make better decisions using data and analytics. His most recent book, “The House Advantage: Playing the Odds to Win Big in Business” draws on his unique experiences at the table and in the sports world to create a truly accessible book about analytics. In 2012, Ma founded a company called tenXer with the vision to revolutionize human capital management by using data and analytics to create better management, recruiting and evaluation tools.

Girl Geek Academy programs are for girls from the age of five right through to 95.\r\n\r\nSarah has been immersed in tech and STEM for most of her career.  Learning how to code at the age of five and building websites and digital products throughout her teens, Sarah was confronted by the negative stereotypes around girls and tech within the teaching world.  She has also worked across Australia and Silicon Valley, where she witnessed first-hand the challenges faced by women in the industry.\r\n\r\nHelping inspire a generational shift in the way political leaders, schools, young girls and professional women think about and practice STEM, Girl Geek Academy has trained more than 1000 teachers in #MissMakesCode, the world’s first hackathon for girls aged five to eight. That equates to a reach of more than 10,000 students in Australia now exposed to STEM education from the age of five.\r\n\r\nGirl Geek Academy is also behind Australia's first all-women hackathon, #SheHacks, and Australia's first all-women makerfest, #SheMakes. An Anthill Smart 100 finalist, it partnered with the Victorian government to deliver a hackathon tackling family violence in Australia and launched the world’s largest all-women incubator. Always innovating, this year the academy broadened its youth focus with a cyber security pop-up workshop for tweens, aged 9-13.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Sarah won the Australian Women’s Weekly Woman of the Future award in the Entrepreneur and Business category and was awarded the QUT Young Innovation and Entrepreneurship Alumni Award. Sarah is also a finalist for Cosmopolitan Woman of the Year. In 2017 Sarah joined the panel on the Network Ten and Foxtel Lifestyle topical news show, Common Sense.\r\n\r\nAn active community contributor, Sarah works with the Leonardo group and Science Gallery Melbourne, is a member of the Victorian Minister's Advisory Council for Gender Equality, an ambassador for Brisbane City Council’s youth program, Visible Ink, and is a member of the Future of Work Summit advisory board. She also sits on the VicHealth Youth Taskforce and is a VicHealth champion.",

Over the course of his career he’s built cloud, mobile, windows, web and interactive SMS applications (yep, SMS!). He writes much less code now than he did before, but he keeps the latest version of Visual Studio and VS Code installed on his computer, you know, in case of an emergency. \r\nHe’s traded in the IDE for the whiteboard and will find a reason to go to one in almost any meeting. Irwin lectures from time to time at local universities, drawing from his experiences across life to weave technology lessons that are sometimes insightful and most times practical.\r\nIrwin is a member of the Global Communications and Technology Team of Congress WBN, a faith-based organization that spans the globe, where he provides insights in software architecture and development support on a diverse set of human-development initiatives. \r\nIrwin and his wife have two beautiful daughters who teach him every day that the journey is best when it is shared.",

This talk will cover how existing projects are using GitHub Action to hope that all projects, despite their size, can benefit collectively from knowledge sharing. The benefit of Actions is that the majority are shareable and open source.
